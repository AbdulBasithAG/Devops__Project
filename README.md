DevOps Project — GKE CI/CD Pipeline

This project shows a simple end-to-end DevOps pipeline that deploys a sample application to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using:

Terraform → creates the GKE cluster

GitHub Actions → CI/CD

Docker Hub → stores the image

Kustomize → manages Kubernetes manifests

Prometheus & Grafana → basic monitoring
